Noisy uses this quota to save your playlists and preferences so next time you come to have them instantly loaded. Typically, in 5MB Noisy should be able to save playlists with a total items count of around 13000-14000 before running out of space. Noisy warns the user both when quota gets above 4MB and when it reaches the limit."
